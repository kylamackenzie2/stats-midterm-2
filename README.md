Midterm 2 for STA309

This Midterm dealt with two problems. The first being the relationship between milk production and milk consumption. I created 4 different plots comparing global production and consumption rates from 1961-2022. The second problem analyzed the sentiments of two albums by Taylor Swift. I chose Midnight and Red and was able to see sentiment of each album (positive or negative) as well as the relationship between sentiment and other variables such as tempo, danceability, and others. I created a dashboard containing 6 different plots including wordclouds, scatterplots, and a bar plot showcasing these relationships.
